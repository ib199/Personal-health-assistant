This repository contains a voice-enabled Personal Health Assistant application built using Python and Streamlit. The system takes user voice input, analyzes the symptoms using datasets, and provides:

- Suggested health advice
- Recommended doctors
- Shopping list assistance
- Voice-based interaction

Each module includes:

- Cleaned datasets
- Streamlit-based user interface
- Voice processing capability
- Python scripts for health suggestions and data handling

The project demonstrates end-to-end application development — including voice processing, dataset management, rule-based prediction, and a deployment-ready Streamlit interface.
